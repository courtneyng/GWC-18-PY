You enter a room in the middle of the ship. It is dimly lit and has a couple torches.
Seems like they did not know what to do with it. It is almost completely empty.
It is just an area where they can walk through serving no other purpose.
There is a bright circle where lay ladder which you can climb to get to the deck.
You hear stomping all over the top of the ship.
This sounds like real bad news.

They start to approach with guns loaded in their hands.
One of the men shoot a single bullet barely missing your head.

You do not understand it fully.
You see dotted lines leading up to an X.

You can already tell by the confidence in his voice who he is.
